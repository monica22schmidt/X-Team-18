# X-Team 18 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
..*As a group, based on skill and availablity</br>
  -For each project, check with each member every two days to make sure everyone is making relatively smooth progress with the tasks they      were delegated. If anyone is having trouble, others should help and perhaps offer to share responsibility of completing that task.</br> 


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
  -Send messages in the group chat when having issue and when task is completed</br>
  -Meet together at the designated meeting day(Sunday at 7pm) to collaberate</br>

## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
  -Be honest when you are struggling</br>
  -Don't be afraid to ask questions</br>
  -Don't be afraid to speak up when you are not comfortable with the part you are assigned</br>


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
  -Be honest about things going on in your life</br>
  -Don't be afraid to ask for help</br>
  -We will work as a team to complete the assignment</br>


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
  -Always answer group chat and email</br>
